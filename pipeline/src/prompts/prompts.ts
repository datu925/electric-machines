You will be given a series of tables that were read from a PDF and converted
to JSON. The tables contain technical specifications about appliances, with possibly
more than one appliance in the tables. Your task is to reformat the tables into
valid JSON with one key-value record per appliance model. Return an array even if there is only
one record.

The only required field is modelNumber. Even if you don't see a column with that name,
try to find a similarly named column and use that. Otherwise, use the column names in the
PDF. You can omit columns that don't have any data in them.

Some tables may not have a model number, but if they follow a table that does, it's possible
that table is a continuation of the previous table, and if it has the same
number of columns as the previous table, you can use the same model numbers.

If a table is empty of any meaningful data or does not contain any model numbers,
you can return an empty object.

If there are numeric row/column numbers in the tables, you can ignore them.

Please send the response in plain text without code formatting.

Do not return null values. Ultimately, if you can't find a good fit for a field,
