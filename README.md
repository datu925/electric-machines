## Data Pipeline

The data pipeline will eventually take a list of URLs, retrieve web content, extract tables/text, parse, and return records fit to our schema. For now, we have coverage of only some of these steps.

### Web content retrieval (not implemented)

### Extract Tables/Text (Python)

This step is in Python based on the strength of the libraries available in each language (specifically, Camelot seems to be the best PDF table extractor, perhaps in any language). In the long term, it would be nice to consolidate to all Typescript.

Pre-work: get a modern Python and virtual environment (if you're not familiar, ask on Slack). I recommend `venv`. Install dependencies with `pip -r install requirements.txt`.
Then, check out the additional installation instructions for Camelot: https://camelot-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/install-deps.html.

Input of this stage: PDF files in a directory organized by appliance type and manufacturer. The expectation is `data/<appliance_type>/<manufacturer>/<any_identifier>/` to identifier a directory, under which there should be a file called `raw.pdf`.

Usage: `python -m pipeline.extract_tables [<filter>]`, where `<filter>` is a filepath under `data/` such as `heat-pumps` or `heat-pumps/rheem`.

Output of this stage: saved tables in CSV format in a `tables/` subdirectory in the folder specified above.

### Reformat Tables (Node)

This step and all subsequent steps use Node.js. This step relies on LLMs. The LLM provider is ultimately flexible, but for now, we'll use OpenAI/GPT. This step will cost money, but the costs are pretty reasonableÂ as long as we're being careful.

We rely on the LLM to:

1. sensibly ignore extraneous rows/columns
2. figure out which empty cells should be filled with which text
3. figure out which column is the model number. We don't remap any other columns at this time, but finding the model number is essentialy for the next steps of the pipeline.

Pre-work: I'd like to switch to Yarn eventually, but for some reason I was having trouble getting it to work, so for now, install `npm` and then do `npm install` from inside the `pipeline/` directory.

Then, set up an account and API key with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product). Yes, this costs money. No, it won't cost a lot unless you do something dumb. Put the API key in a `.env` file under `pipeline/` with variable name `OPENAI_API_KEY`. To make sure everything's running, run the test script with `npm run tsc && node build/src/test_request.js`. If you get 3 dad jokes, you're in good shape.

Input of this stage: previous stage output

Usage: `npm run tsc && node build/src/reformat_tables.js --wait 100 --folders <folders>`

The `<folders>` are walked recursively, so only pass in multiple if they don't overlap.

Output of this stage:

- for each input table, a `.json` file from the LLM is created in the `reformatted/` directory. It should just be a possibly-empty list of reformatted records.
- a `dropped_files.json` file in the `runs/` directory, noting which files could not be parsed by the LLM.

### Merge and Filter

We then merge the reformatted tables by model number and do a minimal-effort filter on the results to try to get rid of garbage models. The output of this stage is still schema-less.

Usage: `npm run tsc && node build/src/merge_tables.js --folders <folders>`

### Rename Columns

We now go back to the LLM to rename columns to try to fit our schema. We don't do this earlier to avoid throwing out/losing data too early, since a lot of things can go wrong in this stage.

Usage: `npm run tsc && node build/src/rename_columns.js --wait 100 --folders <folders>`

### Validate Against Schema (partially implemented)

We will validate the data against a schema using ajv. For now, we simply validate against the final serving API schema. Eventually, we may first validate against a broader schema than the API schema that would have, for instance, multiple fields for different units (e.g. inches vs millimeters), and then transform that collected data into the served version. The latter is our canonical schema and what we serve to customers.

Usage: `npm run tsc && node build/src/validate_data.js --folders <folders>`

### Review (manual)

For now, we'll inspect output by hand. This probably won't scale in the long-term, but is fine for now. Eventually we can have better machine-grading to help focus our human review time.

### Commit (manual)

Committed records should be added to the database so they can be served.
