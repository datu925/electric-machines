        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          In the next few decades, we&rsquo;ll replace 1 billion household
          machines and appliances, and it's critical for the climate that we
          replace them with clean electric versions instead of the fossil
          fuel-based appliances of the past. To help consumers choose and
          compare these machines, take advantage of tax incentives, and assist
          contractors in finding the right fit, we need a centralized platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Spring 2024 semester, our team of four is diligently
          working on this project as part of the Computing for Good course at
          Georgia Tech. We are collaborating closely with Rewiring America to
          develop this essential tool.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Create a database and API for household electric appliances such as
          furnaces, heat pumps, and water heaters, and use it to build a
          consumer-facing web app.
        </p>
        <p>Tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Collect nomenclatures: the organizational structure of appliance
            model numbers and what they represent.
          </li>
          <li>Determine how to represent it in a database.</li>
          <li>Create a parser that searches the database for matches.</li>
          <li>
            Construct a front-end that takes applicance model numbers, finds
            matches, and unpacks it for a user.
          </li>
        </ul>

              Along with Kevin, Dan will focus on the data discovery workstream,
              which focuses on where appliance data sources are located. The
              goal is to have a comprehensive understanding of all makes/models
              of target appliances, validated by other aggregators in the space.
              Along with Chris, Dan will also focus on the data processing
              workstream, which is concerned with turning those data sources
              into usable data that fits our schemas. This will involve
              ingesting web resources and processing them to extract the data we
              care about. Dan is also the team liaison with Rewiring America
              since he has a preexisting relationship with them.

        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Dan</strong>
            <br />
            <u>Highlights:</u> Frontend changes prior to field evaluations.
            Field evaluations and field evaluation writeups. Wrapped Python
            script in Node. Explored feeding all tables to GPT at once (good)
            and feeding GPT the PDF text outside of tables (bad).
            <br />
            <u>Challenges:</u> Naively feeding GPT the PDF text didnâ€™t work
            <br />
            <u>Next Steps:</u> Get the PDF text in and then run lots of data
            through the pipeline
            <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Kevin</strong>
            <br />
            <u>Highlights:</u> Ran metadata through the pipeline to spot trends
            in the model data that is not validated. Wrote deployment and
            sustainability report for P7.
            <br />
            <u>Challenges:</u> Differences between Mac and Windows made using
            the pipeline difficult initially. OpenAI API key is at a lower tier
            than the pipeline is designed for, so some data is lost in the
            process. <br />
            <u>Next Steps:</u> Write script to convert .csv output into JSON
            data files separated by appliance type. Write user manual for P8.
            Put more data through the pipeline. <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Ricky</strong>
            <br />
            <u>Highlights:</u> Updated results table to add more columns and
            filtering options on the headers. Rehaul frontend to remove query
            parameters and initial user inputs. Added an expandable section to
            give info about table headers.
            <br />
            <u>Challenges:</u> Unable to add icons to tabulator tooltip & other
            issues with tabulator.
            <br />
            <u>Next Steps:</u> Add imperial/metric selection, and change the
            results table accordingly along with API call.
            <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            <strong>Chris</strong>
            <br />
            <u>Highlights:</u> Added support for induction stove appliances.
            Refactor the backend API such that it can be ran locally. In the
            final step of converting the backend URL request to type-based
            approach and supports optional query parameters. Decided a data
            schema that supports both imperial and metric units.
            <br />
            <u>Challenges:</u> The backend API testing was only conducted
            through slow Vercel deployments. Spent a few hours on making it
            testable locally.
            <br />
            <u>Next Steps:</u> Finalized the multiple unit data schema from the
            backend and add support for looking up data in both metric and
            imperial units. Discussion
