      WARNING: This product is not approved for installa-
      tion at 2000 meters (6,561 feet) above sea level or
      higher. Installation at higher altitudes may result in
      control and unit failures due to electrical arc tracking
      between electrical components on the invertor drive
      control board possibly resulting in fire, electrical
      shock, property damage, personal injury or death.

The RP17 Classic Plus® Series inverter-driven Three-Stage Heat
Pump is part of a new line of Rheem smart heating, cooling and

tions. Also each unit bears the UL mark and each unit is
certified to UL 1995 safety standards.                                            RETST700SYS
Each unit has undergone specific strain and modal testing to
assure tubing ( 27 ) is outside the units natural frequency and that
the suction and discharge lines connected to the compressor
withstand any starting, steady state operation, or shut down
forces imposed by the compressor.
All units have been sound tested in sound chamber to AHRI 270
rating conditions, and A-weighted Sound Power Level tables
produced, assuring units have acceptable noise qualities (see
page 12). Each unit has been ran in cooling operation at 95°F
and 47°F and sound ratings for the RP17 range from as low as
67 dBA to 74.3 dBA.
All units have been ship tested to assure units meet stringent
"over the road" shipping conditions.
As manufactured, all units in the RP17 family have cooling capa-
bility to 40°F. Addition of low ambient control will allow the unit
to operate down to 0°F. Factory testing is performed on each
unit. All component parts meet well defined specification and
continually go through receiving inspections. Each component
installed on a unit is scanned, assuring correct component uti-
lization for a given unit capacity and voltage. All condenser coils
are leak tested with pressurization test to 550#'s and once
installed and assembled, each units' complete refrigerant
system is helium leak tested. All units are fully charged from the
factory for up to 15 feet of piping. All units are factory run tested.
The RP17 has a 10-year conditional unit replacement warranty
(registration required) and a 10 year limited parts warranty.

Application Guidelines

1. Intended for outdoor installation with free air inlet and outlet. Outdoor fan external static pressure available is less than 0.01 -in. wc.
2. Minimum outdoor operation air temperature for cooling mode without low-ambient operation accessory is 55°F (12.8°C).
3. Maximum outdoor operating air temperature is 125°F (51.7°C).
4. For reliable operation, unit should be level in all horizontal planes.
5. Use only copper wire for electric connections at unit. Aluminum and clad aluminum are not acceptable for the type of connector

   provided.
6. Do not apply capillary tube indoor coils to these units.
7. Factory - supplied filter drier must be installed.

1) Do not exceed 150 ft linear line length.
2) Do not exceed 50 ft vertical separation between indoor and outdoor units.
3) * 3/4" vapor line should only be used for 2 ton systems if outdoor unit is below or at same level as indoor unit to assure proper oil return.
4) Always use the smallest liquid line allowable to minimize refrigerant charge.
5) Applications shaded in light gray indicate capacity multipliers between 0.90 and 0.96 which are not recommended, but are allowed.
6) Applications shaded in dark gray are not recommended due to excessive liquid or suction pressure drop.

1) Do not exceed 47 meters linear line length.

2) Do not exceed 15 meters vertical separation between indoor and outdoor units.

3) * 19.05mm [3/4 in.] vapor line should only be used for 2 ton systems if outdoor unit is below or at same level as indoor unit to assure proper oil return.

4) Always use the smallest liquid line allowable to minimize refrigerant charge.

5) Applications shaded in light gray indicate capacity multipliers between 0.90 and 0.96 which are not recommended, but are allowed.

6) Applications shaded in dark gray are not recommended due to excessive liquid or suction pressure drop.
