HYBRID ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP

The Hybrid Electric heat pump water heater from American is the most
cost effective energy-efficient option available for consumers who want to
save money on their utility bills. The Hybrid Electric heat pump can reduce
water heating costs up to 73% and provide payback in 2-3 years. With
annual savings of $305 or more, there is no better way to go green.

HOW DO THEY WORK?

· Absorb ambient heat from the surrounding air to heat water using a compressor
   and environmentally-friendly R134a refrigerant

   · Self-contained heat pump unit is integrated into the top of the tank

   · Multiple operating modes to maximize efficiency and performance
