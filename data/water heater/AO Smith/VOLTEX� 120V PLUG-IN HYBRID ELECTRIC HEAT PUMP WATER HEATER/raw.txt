The Voltex 120V Plug-In Hybrid Electric heat pump water heater from A. O. Smith
makes it easier than ever for consumers to electrify for an energy-efficient option to
save money on their utility bills. These models plug into a standard wall outlet for
easy installation and provide annual savings up to $118 on utility bills* compared
to a gas water heater. Plus homeowners gain added peace of mind with new leak
protection features including leak detection and automatic water shutoff.

HOW DO THEY WORK?
