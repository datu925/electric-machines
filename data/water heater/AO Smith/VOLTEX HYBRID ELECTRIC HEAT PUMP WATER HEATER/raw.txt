VOLTEX® HYBRID ELECTRIC
HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER

The Voltex Hybrid Electric heat pump water heater from A. O. Smith is the most
cost effective energy-efficient option available for consumers who want to save
money on their utility bills. Voltex can reduce water heating costs up to 74% and
provide payback in 2-3 years. With annual savings up to $579*, there is no better
way to go green than Voltex.

HOW DO THEY WORK?
Absorb ambient heat from the surrounding air to heat water using a compressor and
"Environmentally-Friendly" R134a refrigerant
· Self-contained heat pump unit is integrated into the top of the tank
· Multiple operating modes to maximize efficiency and performance
